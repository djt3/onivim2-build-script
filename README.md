# Onivim 2 Build Script and Appimage
Build script for onivim 2, for Ubuntu. Other distros should build, just install deps manually. Outputs an AppImage to ./oni2/\_release. Tested on Zorin OS 16 Beta. Built AppImage in release section, should support anything with glibc later than ubuntu lts glibc version.
